## Features

- **Customizable Tempo:** Adjust the tempo (BPM) from 20 to 300 with the input field, slider, or the up/down buttons.
- **Long-Press Tempo Buttons:** Hold the "+" or "−" buttons to continuously adjust BPM.

- **Volume Control:** Adjust the metronome volume with a slider, complete with a percentage display.
- **Multiple Time Signatures:** Choose from a wide range of time signatures, including beats per measure (1–16) and beat units (1, 2, 4, 8).

## Support

When I began developing apps, my mission was simple: to create genuinely helpful tools and offer them for free. In a world saturated with paid features and ads, I aimed to build something that anyone could use without cost, simply to make life a little easier. My apps have always been ad-free, and some, like this project, are open-source. If my work can help even a small group of people become more efficient or solve a problem, it’s worth it.
